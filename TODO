ipfw2 on FreeBSD/5 (5.1 has pf)

ipchains sleazy exec

audit addr_ntos() for non-zero'd host bits

make *_loop() prevent modification within loop, or modify only
post-iteration

prefix everything with dnet_*, maybe new API with common dnet_t handle?

more documentation and example code

ip-cooked.c: use RTM_RESOLVE for ip_lookup_mac() (GetBestInterface()?)

add a way to enable ip forwarding?

finish IPv6 support everywhere (fw, route, ip6, win32, etc.)

reimplement win32 fw (lost with laptop hd crash!@#$%)

NAT, ipsec interface?

maybe Checkpoint FW-1 support, via OPSEC (hrr)

1. arp_loop doesn't work
2. eth_send doesn't work
3. intf_set doesn't work
4. route_loop only works
5. arp_show doesn't work
6. route_loop doesn't work
7. IP Filter should work, but untested
8. ipfw support, but no ipfw2

arp-{bsd,ioctl} both b0rked on unixware

eth_send() doesn't allow src mac spoofing on MacOS X (no
BIOCSHDRCMPLT) without patch (http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/),
also b0rked on BSD/OS, says markus

no support for ICMP code in ipfw, therefore none in fw-ipfw.c

need reliable, legit Tru64, Unixware, and AIX accounts with root
access to finish the ports to those platforms...
